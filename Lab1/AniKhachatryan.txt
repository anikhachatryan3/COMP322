Copy of README Document:

02/22/2020: I just started working on the project. I created the Lab1.c file, the README 
            file, the makefile, and the AniKhachatryan file to submit. So far, I have gotten
            the child process and parent process to both work successfully. I just need to 
            get the USER, CUSER, SYS, and CSYS to print correctly along with making sure if 
            the RETVAL is correct.
            Status: working; mostly complete.
