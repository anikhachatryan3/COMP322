README Document:

02/22/2020: I just started working on the project. I created the Lab1.c file, the README 
            file, the makefile, and the AniKhachatryan file to submit. So far, I have gotten
            the child process and parent process to both work successfully. I just need to 
            get the USER, CUSER, SYS, and CSYS to print correctly along with making sure if 
            the RETVAL is correct.
            Status: working; mostly complete.

02/29/2020: We were told that having 0s for USER, CUSER, SYS, and CSYS is fine. I fixed the 
            value that I was getting for RETVAL. I have also deleted some unneeded files
            from my repository as well as ignoring some of them, such as the .vscode folder, 
            the .DS_Store, and the ._.DS_Store.
            Status: working; complete
