READ.me file:

05/09/2020: I created the matrix_add.c file, the matrix_gen.c file, the makefile, and the 
            READ.me file. I also started working on the matrix_gen.c file, and it works as 
            intended (it stores the randomly generated numbers in a .txt file).
            Status: Not complete.
